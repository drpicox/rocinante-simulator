## Features

- Interactive 3D visualization of the solar system and nearby star systems
- Realistic relativistic rocket physics calculations
- Travel time dilation effects (observer time vs ship time)
- Fuel consumption calculations
- Click on celestial bodies to view detailed information
- Visual range indicators and travel lines
- Configurable ship parameters (mass, fuel, acceleration, efficiency)

## Physics

The travel calculations are based on relativistic rocket physics from:
